- Data:
> We use the Bike Share data provided by Udacity about the Bike rideshare service in San Francisco for the year 2017. We wanted to find relationships and insights 

- Findings:

> We have a higher base of user who are Subscribers than a one-time customer.

> Also, we have more Male users than Female users

> Most of our users are between the age of 25 and 50 with the highest segment is 30 years old

> We found that Female users tend to use the bike at longer duration than Male users.

> Also, customer use the bike service for a longer duration than subscribers of the bike service which might be becuase that most of the customers who are not subscribers are actually tourist who use the bike to enjoy thier time in San Francisco.

> Male users tend to be older and have an older median than the Female users

> Females use the bike service for a longer period whether they are customers of subscribers. Hence, if we want to target longer usage we should target the Female more in out Marketing campaign

> Subscribers are older in general for both genders and customers tend to be younger and less than 40 years old in general. Therefore, when targeting tourist we should focus on young customers. On the other hand, when targeting the increase of the subscribtion number we should target the 30 until 45 years old audiance
